## Purpose

Mostly these notes are here as a way for me to structure my thoughts on cybersecurity, helping me to plan what I need to study. I find that writing things down is the best way to solidify my own understanding.

I'd seen some similar public notes from other people in the industry and decided it was a great way to keep on top of where I am and where I'd like to be.

## What's Inside?

This site is a living document of my journey through the world of cybersecurity. As I explore different topics, I add my notes here. You'll find a growing collection of information on various subjects, including:

*   **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence):** A collection of my favorite tools and techniques for gathering information on networks, people, and other digital assets from publicly available sources.
*   **The Dark Web:** Guides on how to approach this part of the internet safely, with a focus on operational security (OpSec), anonymity, and the tools required for research.
*   **Security Tools:** Breakdowns of essential tools of the trade, from web application proxies like Burp Suite to reconnaissance frameworks like OWASP Amass.
*   **Cybersecurity Companies:** Overviews of key players in the industry, such as CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Microsoft, detailing their core products and contributions.

If you find these notes helpful, then that's great. If you'd like to get in touch, there are plenty of ways mentioned in the "Contact Me" menu item above.

I'm slowly moving my notes and links over to this site. It's going to take a while, so please bear with me.
