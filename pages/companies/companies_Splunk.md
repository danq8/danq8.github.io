Splunk is a market leader in software for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data, often referred to as the "Data-to-Everything Platform." While its platform has broad applications in IT operations and observability, it is most widely known in the cybersecurity community for its powerful Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) capabilities.

Splunk's core strength is its ability to ingest vast amounts of data from virtually any source, index it, and make it searchable in real-time, which is foundational for modern security operations.
