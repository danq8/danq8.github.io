## Purpose

Mostly these notes are here, as a way for me to structure my thoughts on Cyber security, helping me to plan what I need to study.

I'd seen some similar notes from other people, and decided it was a good way to keep on top of where I am and where I'd like to be.

If you find these notes helpful, then that's great.
