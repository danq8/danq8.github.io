# TIBRE-EU

Stands for Threat Intelligence-based Ethical Red Teaming

TIBER-EU is a European framework for threat intelligence-based ethical red-teaming. It provides comprehensive guidance on how authorities, entities, and threat intelligence and red-team providers should work together to test and improve the cyber resilience of entities by carrying out controlled cyberattacks.

The TIBER-EU framework is designed for entities that provide core financial infrastructure (including those whose cross border activities fall within the regulatory remits of several different authorities) and national/supranational authorities. It can be used for entities in all critical sectors, not just the financial sector. In addition to a number of mandatory requirements, the framework also includes optional requirements that can be adapted to the specificities of individual jurisdictions. The TIBER EU framework harmonises threat intelligence-based ethical red-teaming and facilitates mutual recognition, reducing the burden on entities and authorities alike.
