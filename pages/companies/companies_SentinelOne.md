SentinelOne is a cybersecurity company that has pioneered an AI-powered platform for autonomous endpoint protection. Their solution is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats in real-time across an organization's entire digital estate.

The core of their offering is the Singularityâ„¢ Platform, which unifies Endpoint Protection (EPP), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), cloud security, and identity threat detection into a single, autonomous solution.

### The Singularity Platform

*   **AI-Powered Prevention:** Uses static and behavioral AI models to block malware, exploits, and ransomware before they can cause damage.
*   **Autonomous Detection & Response:** The platform can independently identify and remediate threats without human intervention, significantly reducing response times.
*   **Extended Detection and Response (XDR):** Ingests data from across the entire technology stack (endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, email, network) to provide comprehensive visibility and context for threat hunting and investigation.
*   **Cross-Platform Support:** Provides coverage for Windows, macOS, Linux, and cloud-native environments like Kubernetes.
