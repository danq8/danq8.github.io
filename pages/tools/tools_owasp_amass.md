The OWASP Amass Project has developed a framework to help information security professionals perform network mapping of attack surfaces and external asset discovery using open source intelligence gathering and reconnaissance techniques.

The framework includes a collection engine for asset discovery, an asset database for storage of findings, and the Open Asset Model, used by various tooling to help understand attack surfaces.
