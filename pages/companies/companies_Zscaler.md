Zscaler is a cloud security company that specializes in providing a Zero Trust security platform. Its cloud-native architecture is designed to securely connect users, devices, and applications, regardless of location, effectively replacing traditional network security appliances like firewalls and VPNs.

The company's core offering is the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, a global cloud platform that acts as an intelligent switchboard between users and applications.

### Key Platforms

*   **Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA):** A Secure Web Gateway (SWG) delivered from the cloud. It inspects all internet-bound traffic in real-time to protect against malware, phishing, and other advanced threats, while enforcing corporate and compliance policies.
*   **Zscaler Private Access (ZPA):** A Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) service that provides secure access to internal applications without placing users on the corporate network. It creates direct, secure connections between authenticated users and specific applications, making it a modern replacement for VPNs.
*   **Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX):** A monitoring solution that provides visibility into user experience and application performance, helping IT teams quickly identify and resolve connectivity and performance issues.
