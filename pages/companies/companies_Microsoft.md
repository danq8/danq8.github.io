Microsoft has become a dominant force in the cybersecurity market by deeply integrating security into its enterprise and cloud platforms. Its security portfolio is designed to provide a unified solution that leverages AI and automation to protect organizations across their entire digital estate.

The platform is built around a few core, interconnected product families:

### Key Security Solutions

*   **Microsoft Sentinel:** A cloud-native SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) solution. It collects data from across the enterprise to provide threat detection, investigation, and automated response.
*   **Microsoft Defender:** A comprehensive XDR (Extended Detection and Response) platform that provides unified protection for endpoints (Defender for Endpoint), cloud workloads (Defender for Cloud), identities, and applications like Office 365.
*   **Microsoft Entra ID:** A cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) solution (formerly Azure Active Directory). It is central to modern Zero Trust security models, providing secure authentication and access control for users and devices.
*   **Microsoft Purview:** A data governance and compliance solution that helps organizations discover, classify, and protect sensitive data wherever it lives.
