Wiz is a cloud security company that has rapidly gained prominence for its agentless approach to securing cloud infrastructure. The company provides a comprehensive Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) that helps organizations identify and remediate risks across their entire cloud environment.

The Wiz platform connects to a company's cloud environment (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) via APIs and provides a deep, contextual view of security risks without needing to deploy any agents on individual workloads.

### The Wiz Security Platform

*   **Agentless Scanning:** Scans cloud configurations, workloads, and data stores without requiring any software to be installed on the resources themselves, simplifying deployment and eliminating performance overhead.
*   **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM):** Identifies misconfigurations, compliance violations, and excessive permissions across the cloud stack.
*   **Cloud Workload Protection (CWP):** Detects vulnerabilities, malware, and exposed secrets within virtual machines, containers, and serverless functions.
*   **Security Graph:** Provides a powerful graph-based visualization of toxic combinations of risks, allowing security teams to prioritize the most critical issues that create attack paths to sensitive assets.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanning:** Scans IaC templates (like Terraform and CloudFormation) to find and fix security issues before they are deployed to the cloud.
