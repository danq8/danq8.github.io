## Bug Bounty Programs

A Bug Bounty program is a crowdsourced security initiative that rewards individuals (often called "security researchers" or "ethical hackers") for discovering and reporting security vulnerabilities in an organization's websites, applications, or networks.

Companies use bug bounty programs to leverage a diverse pool of talent to find security flaws that their internal teams might miss. Payouts, or "bounties," are based on the severity and impact of the discovered vulnerability. These programs are often managed through platforms like HackerOne or Bugcrowd, which provide a framework for submission, triage, and payment. It's a proactive way for companies to improve their security while providing a legal and rewarding outlet for security researchers.
