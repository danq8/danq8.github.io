### Mitre
The MITRE Research Program focuses on four key areas: data acquisition, data processing, system sciences, and computer programming. Today, MITRE's independent R&D program supports more than 200 different projects annually, each devoted to expanding scientific and technical knowledge for the public good.

The ATT&CK Emulation Library includes a collection of adversary emulation plans used in published ATT&CK Evaluations.

### MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository (Psuedo code for detection)
[https://car.mitre.org/](https://car.mitre.org/)

The MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE based on the MITRE ATT&CK adversary model. CAR defines a data model that is leveraged in its pseudocode representations, but also includes implementations directly targeted at specific tools (e.g., Splunk, EQL) in its analytics. With respect to coverage, CAR is focused on providing a set of validated and well-explained analytics, in particular with regards to their operating theory and rationale.

### Mitre Caldera

### Mitre D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense)
[https://d3fend.mitre.org](https://d3fend.mitre.org)

D3FEND is designed to complement ATT&CK by focusing on defensive techniques and strategies, whereas ATT&CK primarily focuses on describing offensive techniques used by adversaries. It includes guidance on how organizations can defend against known attack techniques described in MITRE ATT&CK.
